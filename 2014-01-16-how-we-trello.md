We started using Trello on one of our projects
because we wanted better visualization of our process and more flexibility than
Pivotal Tracker could provide. We could no longer get by with the standard
Pivotal Tracker's columns: 

* Icebox
* Backlog
* Done

The standard card states were also getting in our way:

* Started
* Finished
* Delivered
* Accepted
* Rejected

Pivotal Tracker also lacked the concept of WIP limits. Trello doesn't support
WIP limits, however, much easier to see when there is a WIP violation. There is
a also a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kanban-wip-for-trello/oekefjibcnongmmmmkdiofgeppfkmdii?hl=en-US)
that can help visualize WIP.

We're trying to model our current process as much as possible with the
following columns and WIP (work in progress) limits in brackets: 

## Columns 

* Up Next [4] 
* UX / UED [2] 
* Development [2] 
* Staging / Acceptance [2] 
* Done (Production 1.0.0) 
* Done (Next Version 1.1.0) 

## Labels 

We're using different colored labels to represent different things:

* Green: Ready to Pull
* Blue: Expedite (should only be one story at a time with this color) 
* Red: Bug
* Orange: Not Accepted
* Yellow: Blocked

Trello is flexible and simple. Take whatever process you're currently using and
translate it to a Trello board. As you realize that you're no longer bound by
the prescribed method of <project management tool> you may find a better way to
represent your project flow.

Besides managing our client projects we use Trello for all different
types of things:

* Recruiting
* New Hire Onboarding
* Organizing User Groups
* Book Club
* Blogging

Our main point of contact at the client has enjoyed the workflow and simplicity
of Trello, he is now using it for his internal projects as well.

At the time we moved over to Trello we were also struggling with integrating
design and development. We could create two cards for a single story, but this
caused confusion.
