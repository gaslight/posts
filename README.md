# Posts

This repo contains all of our blog content in Markdown format. Why? Becuase
we're not exactly sure where it's all going to live and it's nice to keep
everything in one place no matter where it gets published.

We can also use a familiar workflow to write, edit and submit content -- Pull
Requests!

## How to submit

1. Fork the repo.
1. Create a branch.
1. Create the post and write write write. Commit often.
1. Ready? Fetch and rebase interactively against origin. Your new post should
   be a single commit.
1. Submit a pull request.

## Editing

1. The blog editor (currently @joelturnbull) will review and suggest edits to
   grammar, spelling, etc. This might go back and forth a couple times.
1. Once we're all happy, it'll be merged.

## Posting

Currently, we're publishing to tumblr.

1. Make sure you've [enabled the Markdown editor in your tumblr
   settings](https://www.tumblr.com/settings).
2. Copy/paste your new post on tumblr.
3. Save as draft.
