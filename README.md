# Posts

The "posts" branch contains all of our blog content in Markdown format. Why? Becuase
we're not exactly sure where it's all going to live and it's nice to keep
everything in one place no matter where it gets published.

Avoid the master branch in this repository!! The reason is the Google will penalize
our blog site for duplicate content it finds here.

We can also use a familiar workflow to write, edit and submit content -- Pull
Requests!

## How to submit

1. Clone the repo.
1. Checkout the "posts" branch
1. Create a new branch.
1. Create the post in posts/ and write write write. Commit often.
1. Push the branch
1. Visit Github and click "Pull Request" under "your recently pushed branches"
1. Github will try to compare this pull request against master. Click "Edit" and change "master" to "posts". Then, "Click to create a pull request for this comparison"
1. Ask some people to take a look

## Editing

1. The blog editor (currently @joelturnbull) will review and suggest edits to
   grammar, spelling, etc. This might go back and forth a couple times.
1. Once we're all happy, it'll be merged.

## Adding Images to Posts

1. Create and size the images
2. Checkout the gh-pages branch of this repo
3. Add to assets/images
4. Checkin, commit and push
5. Images will be available at http://gaslight.github.io/posts/assets/images/[image_filename] (may take up to 10 minutes :P)

## Posting

Currently, we're publishing to tumblr.

1. Make sure you've [enabled the Markdown editor in your tumblr
   settings](https://www.tumblr.com/settings).
2. Copy/paste your new post on tumblr.
3. Save as draft.
