# Scraping By: Dev Tips for Designers 

You area designer working in web today. Because you make the things you pretty, you are used to chucking your designs over the developer wall and leaving it there. 

Wrong. 

Any designer worth their salt working in interfaces has to have some basic understanding of how to run a dev project. I don't care how pretty your Dribbble post is, if the feature you added will take 2 weeks, it becomes unnecessary.

On the flipside, you don't need to be one of those des/dev demi-gods to work with developers. Just learn a few terms, learn to love Github, and embrace the terminal (really).


## Learn the Lingo

  I'll be the first to admit that dev terminology is confusing. There is a difference between Ruby and Rails? Git what? Like anything, these take time to learn, but you can focus your effort on some of the most commonly used terms.

<!--ADD SOME TERMS YO-->

## The Terminal is Your Friend...Really

  My only experience with the terminal before working with developers was using it to make my computer say things. Not rocket science. Now I use it to do productive things without killing my computer. Novel concept. There are an infinite number of things you can do in Terminal, I use 3 commands that cover my butt 95% of the time. They are:

  1. cd 2. bundle 3. rails s

<!--   Explain those -->

## Git Foo and Sourcetree

  Github is great, but I don't like the Terminal much. Insert the GUI for Sourcetree. 

<!--   Words and stuff will go here -->

## Conclusion

Blah blah of course when in doubt, talk to the developers. Some summing up of some sort.
