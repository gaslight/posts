To our delight, Steve Klabnik joins us on the second Gaslight podcast.  We
learned about his passion for text-based adventure games at a young age and
why "people problems" are more interesting than "technical problems" when
developing software.  We also discuss how organizations can effectively use
consensus discussion-making for a flatter structure. Finally Steve weighs in
on the merits of Turbo Links and the need for measurable facts when talking
performance.
