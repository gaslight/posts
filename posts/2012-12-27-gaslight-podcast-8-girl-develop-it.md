We met with Sara Chipps and Erin Kidwell to talk about [Girl Develop
It](http://girldevelopit.com/), an organization that holds classes and events
for developers and aspiring developers. In this episode we talk about how Girl
Develop It spread across the country with sold out classes in only 2 years.
Also we discuss creating an inclusive atmosphere and what makes a great
teacher.
