This week we recorded the Podcast at Kevin's house with our past design intern
and now newest full-time hire, Ryan Arthur. In this episode we talk about
learning with digital doodles, HAML & SASS, responsive designs, the importance
of user experience design over aesthetic design, and how to find a design job
you'll love.
