Chris Nelson sat down with The Legend, Corey Haines at the CodeMash
conference. Corey talks about what he's learned from his pair programming tour
across the country.  We also hear about his experience putting together a new
video series called [Build An App with Corey
Haines](http://cleancoders.com/codecast/bawch-episode-1/show).
