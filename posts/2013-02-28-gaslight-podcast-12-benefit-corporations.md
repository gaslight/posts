In this podcast we speak with Kelly Dolan and Michael Kroeger from
[Ingage](http://ingagepartners.com/) about B Corporations. B Corporations are
companies that measure their success by their impact on the planet, the
community, and their employees as well as profits. Lean what a "triple bottom
line" is and what makes these companies special.
