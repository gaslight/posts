## Making our users feel great: The psychology of making things easy to use.

Presented by Josh Walsh, Owner - Designing Interactive

The design industry has lost focus on what it means to be a user experience
designer. It's not about writing requirements, drawing wireframes, graphic
design or even user research. It's about making your users feel great.

While those other skills are important, they are just a means to an end. A way
to enable users to accomplish what they need to accomplish.

We conduct user interviews and usability testing to learn directly from our
users, but our brains aren't wired to express how we feel. So, how can we
learn from our user's feelings to make our products better?

About Josh: Josh is the guy you call when something is hard to use.

He is an award winning user experience designer, interaction designer and
self-proclaimed design raconteur. His work spans from 1 man startup companies
to large applications for the Fortune 100 â€” from elementary school students to
the worlds leading surgeons.

He currently serves as President of Designing Interactive in Cleveland, OH.
