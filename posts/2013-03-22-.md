## About the Event

Ease your mobile app development to the cloud powered by Javascript with Azure
Mobile Services

Javascript, it's not just for browsers anymore. If you are a Javascript
developer today you are no longer confined to the browser frame, you can take
those skills to mobile devices, servers and the cloud. The technology makes it
possible, but it's not easy. You've got a lot of learning to do and a lot of
things to worry about like data, identity, validation, push, scale and
diagnostics to name a few. Azure Mobile Services is there to make it easy. It
provides you a ton of backend services out of the box to help you cloud enable
those client apps utilizing the client side Javascript skills you already
have. If you are a node developer you can go even further. It doesn't stop
there though, it includes client SDKs for IOS, Android, WIndows 8 and a newly
announced library for Phonegap/HTML5 which you can use to reach any device
anywhere. You have to just see it to believe it, and if you come to this talk
you will!
