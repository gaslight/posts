Bio:

[Jim Weirich](http://twitter.com/jimweirich) first learned about computers
when his college adviser suggested he take a computer science course: "It will
be useful, and you might enjoy it." With those prophetic words, Jim has been
developing now for over 25 years, working with everything from crunching
rocket launch data on supercomputers to wiring up servos and LEDs on micro-
controllers. Currently he loves working in Ruby and Rails as the Chief
Scientist at neo, but you can also find him strumming on his ukulele as time
permits.
