We all benefit from a healthy and vibrant tech community in Cincinnati. My
biggest takeaway from [@timfalls'](http://twitter.com/timfalls) talk yesterday
at [QCMerge](http://qcmerge.com) was this: If you want to promote and nurture
an awesome tech community in your city, you have to be willing to give before
you receive.

With this mission in mind, Gaslight's [Chris
Nelson](http://twitter.com/superchris) has just announced the [Cincinnati Web
Tech (CWT) Study Group](http://cwtstudygroup.eventbrite.com)! The course
follows an actual Stanford class (CS142), and gives students the opportunity,
weekly, to learn with one of the best developers and trainers in Cincinnati.
Students will learn:

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  * Ruby
  * Ruby on Rails
  * SQL Databases
  * Security

If you're not a web developer but you want to learn, there couldn't be a
better opportunity, at a negligible cost. [Sign up
here](http://cwtstudygroup.eventbrite.com)!
