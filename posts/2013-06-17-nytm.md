# New York Tech Meetup

Last week, [@too\_mitch][mitch] and I took a quick trip to NYC to check
out the [New York Tech Meetup][nytm]. If it's the first time you've
heard of it, go check out some [old meetups][past]. NYTM was started in
2004 by one of the founders of [Meetup.com][meetup] for the purpose of
letting budding companies, entrepreneur and hackers demo new projects,
sites, apps and other things.

The format is pretty simple: three five minute demos by three different
individuals or organizations followed by five minutes of question and
answers for the whole group. It gets repeated a few times (I think we
saw three sets of demos) during the event. There's also a "Hack of the
Month", where someone demos something interesting they've been working
on, too.

There are a couple of rules, though. First, no pitches or slides. Only
working projects. Second, you're not allowed to ask: "What's your
business model?"

I like these rules. Too often, I hear someone with an idea tell me it's
the next big thing. All they need is a developer and fame and riches
will appear. It's a bunch of junk and I'm sick of hearing it, frankly.

What's different about NYTM is that there is a working demo. The
presenters have figured out a way to get beyond the asking stage and are
well in to the building stage. As a developer, this is exciting to me. I
learned to code on my own, so I'm always excited about getting others
interested.

I was introduced to this scene by [Erin Kidwell][erin]. She'd been
involved in [Girl Develop It][gdi] here in Cincinnati, which frequently
took her to NYC. She's the reason we were able to get tickets -- thanks
for that!

Erin also helped organize [QCMerge][qcmerge] this year. One of the
speakers she suggested was [Nate Westheimer][innonate], who's currently
the Executive Director of NYTM and a Cincinnati native. You can check
out his entire talk right here:

Basically, Nate gave his take on how to cultivate a vibrant tech
community in our city. It's something I'm also passionate about, so
hearing the talk motivated me to continue working here in Cincinnati. I
want to grow our entire tech community -- not just the startup
community, so it's important to note the difference.

See, I believe that startups are a part of a larger community. They're
fledgling businesses, usually in the tech sector.

The real purpose of the trip was to participate in the audience and see
how things work. I'm interested in bringing something similar to
Cincinnati, so checking out another group was a great introduction.
