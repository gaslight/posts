# Web School Cincy

## Why?
### It's our purpose.
### We learn by teaching.
### It will strengthen our community, our region and our profession.

Just like the Rails framework we use to build products for many of our clients, we're opinionated about our best practices. Agile methods have never been a fade to us. We embraced lean practices because they solved real world problems we were experiencing. We champion their use because they work.

Many companies in our community and around the region are coming to this same belief and while we'd like to help them all, clearly that's not practical, or is it?

*Gaslight exists to inspire creators to learn, build and share great things with our community.* That's our purpose statement and while that spirit of learning, building and sharing has always been a part of our culture we now intend for it to be a more intentional part.

## What?
### History
* Day of Ruby
* Little Miami & Ludlow High Schools
* Backbone.js training
* James Smith career day
* Usergroup mentorship
* Conference speaking

We are actively working to launch a full-time six month training program here in Cincinnati with the aim of graduating 24 competent Web developers. Our desire is to welcome the first class before the end of this year, 2013. The program will operate in and around a vibrant Rails consultancy, Gaslight's new (and hopefully soon to be announced) location in downtown Cincinnati.

Gaslighters have established a tradition of teaching, from the inaugural Cincinnati Day of Ruby, to mentorship of students at Little Miami and Ludlow high schools. We've spoken at regional and national software developer conferences and host the Cincinnati iOS, Javascript and Ruby user group meetings each month. James Smith has twice presented software development at his son's (GRADE LEVEL?!) career day. As I begin writing this post I have just completed the material Chris Nelson and I will present to 6th-8th graders at Chaminade-Julienne High School's summer STEM camp.

We love what we do but no more than we love sharing what we do with others who are just as passionate but haven't found the place to practice their craft. We think Gaslight is one such place but there are many others in our town and our region and that number seems to be growing daily.

## How?
### Partnering
* Jeff Casimir (Hungry Academy & gSchool)
* Erin Kidwell (GDI)
* Dave Know (The Brandery)
* Scott Baron (Neo)
* Industry partners with Rails teams already operating in Cincinnati and those wanting to move development jobs here.

About a year ago, we began kicking around the idea of a gSchool-like program here in Cincinnati but we were busy doing many things and really had no desire to own the program. We simply felt it was needed because we needed it, our "competitors" needed it, the startup community needed it and local companies needed it. We knew this because local recruiting firms were screaming for competent Rails developers.

So we asked if anyone else was interested and Scott Baron from Neo's local office said to count him in. Erin Kidwell, then of Girl Develop It said to count her in. Mike Bott of The Brandery said he was interested too. So we all got together and started talking. And we talked. And we talked. And we talked.

Then we talked to Jeff Casimir, co-creator of Hungry Academy and gSchool and it became evident that if anything were going to be done we simply had to stop talking and start doing. So we're doing. And we're doing... You get the picture.

We're seeking other doers too. We're launching Web School Cincy. Don't worry, that's just a working title. We're seeking sponsors and students. You can sign up today and we'll keep you in the loop with all the latest developments. Just visit signup.webschoolcincy.com and leave us your email address and tell us how you'd like to be involved.

Our goal is to create a program that will meet the needs of our community, producing young developers with fire in their bellies and a desire to build something awesome who will team up with entrepreneurs at The Brandery, Cintrifuse or NKU's INKUBATOR, or career change minded 30 and 40 somethings seeking the stability of product work with one of the many companies in our region clamouring for Rails talent, or veterans looking to transition to a civilian career in a growth industry that is as rewarding as serving their country. Who knows, maybe we'll even find a hippy or two wanting to join us at Gaslight. It could happen but it won't happen if we don't take action.
