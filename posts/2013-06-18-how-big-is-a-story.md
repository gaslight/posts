How big is a Story?

In conversations about Kanban, @dougalcorn mentioned [Jeff
Patton's](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/) excellent article [Kanban Over
Simplified](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html).
What was specifically interesting about this article to me was [The mystery of the 
shrinking story](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_shrinking_story.html).

You might be surprised that the term "story", as described by Kent Beck in the
first edition of Extreme Programming Explained, was characterized as "estimable
between one to five ideal programming WEEKS." This was shocking to me, as it
would be to most developers. Not so long ago, here in the office, we would say
that if a story was on it's second day, it needed some help, and if it was on
it's third say, there was something wrong! I imagine that most dev shops are
similar.

What caused this amazing shift in story size? There are a few  reasons.
Customers, in order to plan and asses risk, want estimates, and smaller stories
are easier to estimate. It's also natural for developers, not always experienced
in managing customer relationships, to start seeing the backlog as a todo list
of tasks that need to be completed. But I think one of the main reasons stories
have become so small is to maintain the  illusion of momentum. I personally
think maintaining that illusion is beneficial and maybe even crucial to a good
project.

What is wrong with small stories? They make the backlog longer, and small
stories are harder to reason about and fit together into anything cohesive. But
the real detrimental effect of small stories is loss of focus on the customer's
needs. Small stories lean more towards up-front planning and implementation
rather than customer goals and values. It is not uncommon to break a feature
down to such a detail of implementation, that she is asked to click "Accept",
having no confidence that anything was actually delivered. Asking a customer to
"take our word for it" is fail.

Don't get me wrong, planners should still strive to make stories as small as
possible. However, stories must first and foremost meet a standard minimum
marketability. A minimally marketable feature is "the smallest possible set of
functionality that, by itself, has value in the marketplace". Meeting that
standard is not always easy to do in a few days.

But what about developer happiness and momentum? Isn't it demoralizing to be
working on delivering one piece of functionality week in and week out? Isn't it
satisfying to click  "Start, Finish, Deliver" daily?

It's most important that the stories the customer sees are clearly defining the
value. The most effective way of doing this is to write a story using the format
described in Cohn's [User Stories
Applied](http://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Development-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321205685)
"As a [type of user] I want to [perform some task] so that I can [achieve some
goal]".

I would argue that it's equally as important for developers, behind the scenes,
to continue striving to deliver subsets of functionality on a daily basis. I'm
not sure what the best tool is for that. Velocity is a lie that confuses a customer, 
but motivates a developer.
