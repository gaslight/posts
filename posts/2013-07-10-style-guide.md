# Style Guides: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Grid

I have created the perfect design. Every checkbox is in place, all the type is perfectly aligned. Oh wait, I resized the window and everything IS WRONG. One of the things I miss the most about print design is the certainty that an element will appear precisley where I have placed it in the page. I know exactly the number of words on a page and it will not change. That level of control really appeals to my perfectionist personality. 

When I made the jump to the web, I still wanted to do full-on mockups. All this accomplished was giving the client a reason to be angry when things didn't turn out exactly the same. A year later and a year wiser, I've finally embraced the fact that I can't control everthing, but I can control the important parts.  Combine a framework for a responsive grid and careful design of the main page elements, then throw it all together and let it do it's thing. 

Ok it's a little more complicated than that. My saving grace has been style guides. They come in a vareity of names, but for this purpose, a style guide is a compilation of a site's main elements. This usually consists of buttons, navigation, and anything along those lines. By establishing a strong visual style through the page elements, the feelings behind the design still come through.


## My Process

### 1. Create Wireframes 
Like any good interactive project, start by creating wireframes of the project. Hand sketches are perfect for this. Your main takeaway from these is to establish what elements you think will be used more than once. This can range from icons to pagination. Make a list of these elements. I would try to limit this to around 10 elements.  


* 2. Create Cohesive Element Page

*3. HTML Styleguide
