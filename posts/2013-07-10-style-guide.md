# Style Guides: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Grid

## Intro Paragraph

I have created the perfect design. Every checkbox is in place, all the type is perfectly aligned. Oh wait, I resized the window and everything IS WRONG. One of the things I miss the most about print design is the certainty that an element will appear precisley where I have placed it in the page. That level of control really appeals to my perfectionist personality. 

When I made the jump to the web, I still wanted to do full-on mockups. All this accomplished was giving the client a reason to be angry when things didn't turn out exactly the same. A year later and a year wiser, I've finally embraced the fact that I can't control everthing. What I realized I can do: control the important parts.  Combine a framework for a responsive grid and carefully design the main elements, then throw it all together and let it do it's thing. 

Ok it's a little more complicated than that. My saving grace has been style guides. They come in a vareity of names, but for this purpose, a style guide is a compilation of a site's main elements. This usually consists of buttons, navigation, and anything along those lines. By establishing a strong visual style through the page elements, the feelings behind the design still come through.
