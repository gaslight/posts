We're happy and excited to introduce our newest service, [Twallaby](http://twallaby.com/)!

We host [QCMerge](http://www.qcmerge.com/) and couple of technical get-togethers, like the [Web Tech Drinkup](http://www.meetup.com/Cincinnati-Web-Tech-Drinkup/), here in town. Tweet walls are a pretty standard thing at these kinds of events, but we found the the available services were sorely lacking. Some of them were written in Flash so they couldn't be run from an iOS device, most of them were not customizable.

Twallaby is a customizable tweet wall written in standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It couldn't be simpler to use. Just visit [twallaby.com](http://twallaby.com/) and enter any number of search term to see it in action. 

Twallaby is freely available to use. Running your own event? Sign up for Twallaby's paid service so that you can customize and promote your sponsors!
