Gridlocked

It's not sexy work, but there are hundreds of companies out there with old gridlocked Rails apps. Developed by people who have moved on. Companies doing good business but struggling to innovate.

The fact of the matter is these projects can be very rewarding.  I actually heard Mike Guturl say out load "give me brown field any day". That's why we love Mike. 

We use a tool called Code Climate to "grade" the quality and flexibility of the code we write. Working a Code Climate GPA from a "0.8" to a "2.01" to a "3.98" is a progression of small victories. I think most developer's secret love is refactoring. Maybe that's a geek post for another day.

From a business relationship standpoint, it's exciting to see your clients start to get excited. The outset can be a little tense as we try to understand how each other work. Meanwhile, we go to work with a jackhammer. At some point the dam cracks open, and then it's gushing. Sweet, cold, thirst-quenching features. It's awesome to be able to provide that.

The work always poses interesting problems and challenges, and that's what we're all about.
