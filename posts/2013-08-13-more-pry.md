## How do you step in Pry?

I get asked this all the time.

To step in pry you will need an extra gem. The available gems are `pry-debugger` and `pry-nav`. Both gems add the commands `step`, `next`, and `continue` to the pry REPL. 

I had some bad times with `pry-debugger`. I recommend `pry-nav`, it's been so far, so good. 

I would also recommend taking it straight from the [README](https://github.com/nixme/pry-nav). Add these shortcuts to your ~/.pryrc:

    Pry.commands.alias_command 'c', 'continue'
    Pry.commands.alias_command 's', 'step'
    Pry.commands.alias_command 'n', 'next'

And that was a short post, and that's why I really want to talk about…

## Pry's Killer Feature

There are many separate gems like 'pry-nav' that independently add enhancements to Pry's basic functionality. That's a good thing. It means you can don't have to install all the things, and you can use core Pry within JRuby and other environments that don't play well with C extensions.

But `pry` core has some simple killer features. Killer feature #1: **Syntax highlighting**

I like using debuggers and using them often. It was stated in a talk I reference later that the average dev spends 60% of their time debugging. I spend a lot of time debugging in a debugger, and I want colors.

Still not enough? Killer feature #2: **Tab-completion**.

That's cool, but what I really want to talk about is…

## Why I Still Love Pry 

Earlier, I blogged about why I liked Pry so much as a [discovery tool](http://gaslight.co/blog/pryme-time). I was thrilled to see so much excitement around [Conrad Irwin](https://twitter.com/conradirwin)'s [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDXsEzOHb2M) at RailsConf 2013 (recommended!), and around Pry at the conference. I'd wager Pry shirts outsold any other at the swag table.

But why do people care? The things you can do in `pry`, you can also do in `debugger`. I would argue that you could say the same for Ruby and Java.

Two tools that do similar things differentiate themselves in small ways. My general feeling is, it comes down to the user experience. Which tool is easier to learn and reason about? Which tool is more natural and enjoyable? Which tool is optimized to do things you are trying to do?

My initial concept for this article was to compare the way you do things in Pry vs. debugger, and show how much better Pry is. The truth is, figuring out how to execute things like Pry's `cd` command in debugger took too long for me to continue to entertain this concept. Pry's `cd` changes the value of self. Maybe it's possible to do this in debugger. The point is, this command is core to Pry's workflow, and Pry is tuned for this kind of discovery out of the box.

The ambivalence really stems from the fact that a lot of Rubyists don't consider a debugger an essential part of their workflow. Smalltalk ruined me in this regard, I learned how useful and essential a **good** debugger could be. Fixing bugs is only one piece, the other piece is being present inside a living system, and discovering and understanding libraries through use.
 
## More Cool Things About Pry

 Again, I'd like to re-iterate this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDXsEzOHb2M) for anyone interested in learning more cool things about Pry, and for a simple example of using Pry for this discovery stuff I've been talking about. You'll also learn about:

 - Live code editing from inside the Pry REPL. 
 - `wtf?`
 - `?` and `$` for code browsing 
 - `play`ing lines of code
 - `cd` and `ls` for discovery
 - Running shell commands (e.g. `git diff`) from the Pry REPL
 - Running Pry as your default rails console.
 - Better Errors with Pry
 - Launching Pry automatically on exceptions
