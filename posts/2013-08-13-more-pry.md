## I like Pry but…

Everytime I talk about Pry I invariably hear "I like Pry but…". More specifically, "I like Pry, but I wish I could step", and "I like Pry, but can't I do all of this in debugger?". This article is my attempt to squash this. Let's start with the easy one.

## How do you step in Pry?

To step in pry you will need an extra gem. The available gems are `pry-debugger` and `pry-nav`. Both gems add the commands `step`, `next`, and `continue` to the pry REPL. 

I had some bad times with `pry-debugger`. I recommend `pry-nav`, it's been so far, so good. 

I would also recommend taking it straight from the [README](https://github.com/nixme/pry-nav). Add these shortcuts to your ~/.pryrc:

    Pry.commands.alias_command 'c', 'continue'
    Pry.commands.alias_command 's', 'step'
    Pry.commands.alias_command 'n', 'next'

There are many separate gems like 'pry-nav' that independently add enhancements to Pry's basic functionality. That's a good thing. It means you can don't have to install all the things, and you can use core Pry within JRuby and other environments that don't play well with C extensions.

But `pry` core has some simple killer features.

## Pry Wins: The Short Sell

Here's the quick sell for Pry. Pry has a couple of immediately apparent features over your standard Rails console or Ruby debugger.
 
- Syntax highlighting
- Tab completion

I like using debuggers and REPLs and using them often. It's been stated that the average dev spends 60% of their time debugging. I spend most of my time debugging in a debugger, and I want colors and less typing.

Hopefully that's enough to peak your interest, but the value of Pry runs a lot deeper than that.

## Pry Wins: The Long Sell

Earlier, I blogged about why I liked Pry so much as a [discovery tool](http://gaslight.co/blog/pryme-time). I was thrilled to see so much excitement around [Conrad Irwin](https://twitter.com/conradirwin)'s [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDXsEzOHb2M) at RailsConf 2013 (recommended!), and around Pry at the conference. I'd wager Pry shirts outsold any other at the swag table.

But why do people care? The things you can do in `pry`, you can also do in `debugger`.

Two tools that do similar things differentiate themselves in small ways. It comes down to the user experience. Which tool is easier to learn and reason about? Which tool is more natural and enjoyable? Which tool is optimized to do things you are trying to do?

My initial concept for this article was to compare the way you do things in Pry vs. debugger, and show how much better Pry is. The truth is, figuring out how to execute things like Pry's `cd` command in debugger took too long for me to continue to entertain this concept. Pry's `cd` command changes the value of self in the REPL. Maybe it is possible to do it in debugger, maybe it's not. The point is, the developers of Pry identified that that ability to is core to the kind of workflow that enables discovery. It's a core concept of working with Pry, and one of the first commands you learn to love.

My feeling is that this ambivalence between Pry and debugger really stems from the fact that a lot of Rubyists don't consider a debugger an essential part of their workflow. Smalltalk ruined me in this regard, I've learned how useful and essential a **good** debugger could be. Fixing bugs is only one piece, the other piece is discovering and understanding how our systems and libraries work, by being "inside" of them, through practice rather than "theory". Pry enables this better than any other REPL I've ever worked with.
 
## More Cool Things About Pry

I'd like to re-iterate this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDXsEzOHb2M) for anyone interested in learning how to use Pry, for a simple example of using Pry for this discovery stuff I've been talking about, and about Pry's coolest features. You'll learn about:

 - Live code editing from inside the Pry REPL. 
 - `wtf?`
 - `?` and `$` for code browsing 
 - `play`ing lines of code
 - `cd` and `ls` for discovery
 - Running shell commands (e.g. `git diff`) from the Pry REPL
 - Running Pry as your default rails console.
 - Better Errors with Pry
 - Launching Pry automatically on exceptions
