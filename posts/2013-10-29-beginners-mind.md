# Beginner's Mind

As a custom software development shop, we're always interested in marketing.
Talking about the work we've done and enjoy doing is the best way to reach new
customers.

One of the suggestions we often hear is that we should specialize; focus on a
specific industry. My answer is we have. Our industry is solving
problems.

On a recent trip with [SuperChris], he asked "Do you sometimes feel like
we know our clients' businessess better than they do?" I told him that I
absolutely felt that way. In fact, if I didn't, I should probably stop
working on that project.

## Solving Problems

We're problem solvers. I can't remember who said it, but the code is a side
effect. We're good at listening to someone who might not be technical explain
a problem, mash it up in our brains and deliver something to make that
process better.

## Enter Beginner's Mind

In Zen Buddhism, there's a concept called "beginner's mind", or
[Shoshin]. Wikipedia defines it as:

> It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of
> preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an
> advanced level, just as a beginner in that subject would.

When you focus on a particular industry or niche, you lose that trait. You lose
the ability to have a clear head. You're carrying the baggage of existing
limitations, workflows, processes or vendors. That's not always great.

Opportunities for innovation exist in a million industries in a billion
facilities around the world. What's holding you back? Try to think like
a beginner and less like an expert. Listen to your spouse when you
explain a process. Talk to the new hire and listen when they ask "Why?"

You just might learn something.
