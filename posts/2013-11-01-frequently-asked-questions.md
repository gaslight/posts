# Frequently Asked Questions

## Sales

1. How much will this cost?

   I know, that's what you want to know. Let's get this out of the way
   quickly: I don't know.

   It's true. I have no idea what the amount is going to be when we're
   finished. I also don't know what finished means and you probably
   don't either. As we sit here today, talking about this project, we
   know the least amount about what it will become. As soon as we get
   started, we'll learn more and more every day. More about the project
   and more about working with each other.
   
   Custom software is expensive and risky, but it's what separates your
   business from your competition. You've created a process, (ideally) a
   Proof of Concept and you're ready to own your market. This is where
   we come in.
   
   Instead of me guessing a number and giving it to you, let's figure
   out how we can deliver value faster. Let's start with a few
   questions:
   
   * What's your budget?
   * Are there any deadlines? Big ad spend? New customer coming onboard?
   * What are the most important features?

   ## More about Budget
   
   We've got a post on our blog that covers this topic really well, but
   this is where we'd like to arrive first.
   
   Once we know how much you're willing to invest, we can start to
   figure out how much we can deliver. We know how large the breadbox
   is, so let's start filling it up.

1. Why choose Gaslight over another development shop?

  We're focused on being a long term partner focused on building the most
  value possible for your organization. We have all the pieces, design,
  development, guide. We have a track record a being an awesome partner
  and here's one of our customers you can talk to.

1. I found a freelancer who says she can do it for $10,000. Why would I
   choose Gaslight?

  There's no way anyone can possibly know if this at all an interesting
  project how much effort it will take until we spend some time together.
  Let's spend some time together so I can deeply understand your business
  and what you need. Here's how it will cost to do this.

## Process

1. What is working with Gaslight like?

  In a word? Intense. We'll be moving fast. Faster than you're used to,
  probably.

  We're demanding of our clients. The best measure of success on our
  projects is the time you're available for questions. We want to
  deliver value quickly, so we need you available to test new features,
  answer questions about business logic and think through processes.

  We move in weekly units. During the week, we'll have daily standups at
  a scheduled time. These should be brief &endash; no longer than twenty
  minutes. We'll cover things we're working on, things that are blocking
  us and what's next.

  We also want to have planning meetings to keep the backlog filled with
  work. Planning meetings are typically one hour.

1. Is this staff augmentation?

  No. We run complete projects. Usually, you'll bring a problem or idea
  to us, we'll figure out the best way to solve it and get to work.

  We're confident in our abilities and we make most of the technology
  decisions around our projects.

  If you're looking for more developers to code on your existing app, we
  might not be a good fit. If you have an additional project that can be
  delivered outside a bigger project, we're a good fit for that.

1. What does a team look like?

  Teams change, but the typical makeup is two developers, a designer and
  a project manager. The project manager is your main point of contact
  and helps make sure things are moving slowly.

  You'll probably start working with the manager and a designer. We want
  to get the look and feel and general styles for your application
  developed right away.

  We'll also be filling the backlog with the next week of development
  work. We want the features we build to be valuable as soon as
  possible, so prioritizing is important.

  We value focused time, since context switching is expensive. The
  shorter the cycle between development, testing and acceptance, the
  better. If you wait too long to test and accept, we're accumulating
  risk. That's bad.
