I'm very pleased to announce I've been accepted to speak at
[Wicked Good Ruby](http://wickedgoodruby.com/), Boston's first Ruby
conference! Some of you may have seen me speak about [market analytics
in the MMORPG Eve Online](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPHHfQkKIqg)
at the [Cincinnati Ruby Brigade](http://cincyrb.com). I'm going to be
presenting the same concepts, but further developed and with more
refinement. Here's the full abstract:

> Ever wondered about market trading, analytics or algorithms but didn't want to lose your shirt experimenting? EVE Online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) rich in data with a fully functional, player driven economy. Using some simple concepts and novel tools you can get access to this data and discover interesting things. This talk will introduce you to market analytics and the cruel world of EVE Online.
