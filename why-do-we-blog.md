## Why We Blog, and Why You Should Too

We've been cranking on the Gaslight Blog in an intentional way for quite some time now. Nov first 2013 marks sixteen months of commitment to a consistent release schedule. It's almost like we know what we're doing. Amazingly, yesterday was the first time that we've really sat down as a group and asked ourselves "Why are we doing this? Why is it important to write?" This article is about what we learned.

## Personal Juice

Releasing an article is exciting. On those days when I just know we've got something really juicy to release, you better believe that I'll have a tab open to Google's Real-Time analytics, eyes glued to that "Active Visitors on Site" number. Are eyeballs valuable? I don't much care at this point, I'm over here at the horse track getting a rush watching a number go up and down.

The other piece of data I get a rush off of is comments. I recently wrote an article called Does CoffeeScript have a future that generated over 200 comments between reddit, disqus and twitter. There is beautiful feeling associated with putting something out there that generates enough passion in someone, they can't help but put some words down of their own.

These are the things that I'd like to bottle up but like lightning, it's hard to know when they're going to strike. I know there are compelling things to write about, identifying them consistently is really what I'd like to get good at. compelling story on a consistent basis is what the real media professionals can do better than anyone else.

## To Demonstrate

Cultivating a personal rush is selfish, unhealthy reason to do something but it still feels good. But everything we do as humans is self-serving at it's core. If I go serve at a soup kitchen I'm doing it because it makes me feel like a hero. Is that a bad thing? No, somebody hungry got soup. Just because I win, doesn't mean somebody else has to lose.

Demonstration through blog-writing is a win-win situation. Teaching in and of itself is a valuable process that I'll talk about in a minute. But when you teach in a public way, you gain the benefit of demonstrating your expertise. When you do it on a blog, it's sticky, it doesn't float away into the ether like spoken words do.

Here in the office we've got an ITTT job that emails us whenever somebody comments on one of our blog articles. 

## To Learn

Teaching in and of itself is a rewarding process. You get appreciation, and it forces you to gain a true deep understanding of a subject which you will have forever. To get thoughts out of your head. To release the demons.

    "Why?" has been a recurring theme around the office lately. In life we do so much, so often, before we bother to ask this question.
